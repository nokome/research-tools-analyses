# Analyses of the "Innovations in Scholarly Communication" survey data

# About the survey

The Innovations in Scholarly Communication project was a global survey of 20,663 researchers during 2015/2016 by Jeroen Bosman and Bianca Kramer from the Utrecht University Library, Netherlands

> The online survey employed an open, non-probability sample. A largely self-selected group of 20663 researchers, librarians, editors, publishers and other groups involved in research took the survey, which was available in seven languages. The survey was open from May 10, 2015 to February 10, 2016. It captured information on tool usage for 17 research activities, stance towards open access and open science, and expectations of the most important development in scholarly communication. Respondentsâ€™ demographics included research roles, country of affiliation, research discipline and year of first publication.

A full description of data collection, survey response and methodology is in a data publication in F1000 Research:

# About this repo

The main purpose of these analyses is to ask the data some questions that are relevant to the ongoing development of [Stencila](https://stenci.la) while at the same time using it as a test use case for Stencila. Oh, how meta!... Actually, is it just recursive? :)

We're not trying to make any new, earth shattering discoveries here. Some of the analyses will repeat what Bosman and Kramer and others have already done but done here as an illustration of using Stencila.

The file [`isc.csv`](isc.csv) is Bosman and Kramer's file `cleaned-data-innovations-in-scholarly-communication-survey_def.csv` renamed to something shorter. Because this data is quite large, we didn't want to put it into our [`stencila/examples`](https://github.com/stencila/examples) Github repo.
